> A JIT compiler for Rust


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/someguynamedmatt/lejit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/someguynamedmatt/lejit)


## This is very much a work in progress. Don't expect this to compile yet.

This project is an attempted rewrite of [Bebbington's jit.rs](https://github.com/TomBebbington/jit.rs) and will look very, very similar to it for a while. As that repo has not been touched in a long time a lot of the Rust is out-of-date so a lot of things are probably in error by today's standards

Feel free to help out in any way possible! That includes advice, PRs, or a simple 'good luck' tweeted to me [@_mttyng](https://twitter.com/_mttyng)
